# Building a basic LLM chat app with streamlit
> First steps

This project contains early versions of the chat app built as standalone individual files that you will find in the [`docschat`](docschat/) folder.

All the projects share the same dependencies managed by Poetry.

You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

The projects can be run by typing:

```bash
streamlit run docschat/{example-project}.py
```

The specific details about each example project are tracked in the [`README.md`](../README.md) placed in the parent folder.
