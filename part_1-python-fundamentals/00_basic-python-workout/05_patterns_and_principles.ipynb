    "SOLID is an acronym that groups the five core principles that apply to Object-Oriented Design (OOD):\n",

    "1. Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",

    "### Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "\n",
    "> A class should have only one reason to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class should have only one responsibility, as expressed through its methods. If a class takes care of more than one task, you should separate the tasks into separate classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a single responsibility **does not mean having a single method**. Instead, it has to do with what the class represents in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is closely related to the concept of **separation of concerns**, which suggests that you should split your programs into different sections."
