> a few directories to mimic different scenarios for the tools

+ `orig/` &mdash; where media files are originally kept. These directories are supposed to be cleaned and well-groomed, although there might be duplicated files in different folders.

    in `folder_3/`:
      + `file_1_0.txt` features the same name as a file in `folder_1/` but with different content
      + `file_3_3.txt` features the same content as `folder_2/file_2_4.txt` but with different name


+ `media/` &mdash; where the symbolic links to `orig/` files are kept. A few files are already in `seen/`
