# First version of randfpck

While workable, when creating the unit tests I realized that certain portions of the application were too hard to test, which is a code smeel and a cry for refactoring.

The code and tests have been kept here for reference, as, in order to progress with the tests, very advanced mocking techniques (that were ugly as hell to understand and maintain, but yet worked) might be useful in certain scenarios.
