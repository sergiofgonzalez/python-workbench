# ColorConsole Factory

Create a class called `ColorConsole` that has just one empty method called `log()`. Then, create three subclasses: `RedConsole`, `BlueConsole`, and `GreenConsole`. The `log()` method of every `ColorConsole` subclass will accept a string as input and will print that string to the console using the color that gives the name to the class.

Then create a factory function that takes color as input such as `red`, and returns the related `ColorConsole` subclass. Finally, write a small command-line script to try the new console color factory.
