# Builder pattern

This example illustrates how to use the **builder** pattern for the following `Boat` object:

```python
class Boat:
    def __init__(self, has_motor, motor_count, motor_brand, motor_model, has_sails, sails_count, sails_material, sails_color, hull_color, has_cabin):
        ...
```
