# Product Service GraphQL API implementation
> Step 0: the empty starting point for an Ariadne based implementation of the Products Service API

## Description

This project is the empty template for GraphQL server based on the Ariadne framework that implements the Products service API.

The schema is defined in [web/schema.graphql.py](./web/schema.py), but the rest of the files are empty.

The intention of this project is to illustrate the project structure that should be followed to create a GraphQL microservice using Ariadne framework.

The subsequent steps will populate the different source code files.
