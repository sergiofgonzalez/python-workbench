    "Linear algebra generalizes everything we know about 2D and 3D geometry to study data in any number of dimensions. This means that the machinery we've see on vectors, linear transformations, and matrices can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll define **vector spaces**. Vector spaces are collections of objects we can treat like vectors. These can be arrows in the plane, tuples of numbers, or objects completely different from the ones we've used so far. For example, you can treat images as vectors and take a linear combination of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key operations in a vector space are vector addition and scalar multiplication. With these you can make linear combinations (negation, subtraction, weighted averages, ...) and you can reason about which transformations are linear.\n",

Thus, we will be able to do `v + w`, `w * s` and `s * w` instead of the equivalent `v.add(w)` and `v.scale(s)`. In order to do so, you just need to override the methods: `__add__`, `__mul__` (when the class in on the left of the expression `w * s`), and `__rmul__` (when the class in on the right of the expression `s * w`).\n",
