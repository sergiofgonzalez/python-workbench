        glTranslatef_args (Seq[float, float, float]): a sequence of 3 floating
            points for x, y, z that will change the perspective from which we
            observe the scene. For example, using (0.0, 0.0, -5) will move the
            scene away from the viewer 5 units; (0.0, 0.0, -25) will move it
            further, thus causing the scene to look smaller.By default,

        glRotatef_args (Seq[float, float, float, float]): a sequence of 4
            floating points that will change the angle at which we observe the
            scene. The expected values are for the angle, and then specification
            about an axis given for the second, third, and fourth value. That
