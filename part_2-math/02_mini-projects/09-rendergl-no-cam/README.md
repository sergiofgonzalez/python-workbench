# Simple Rendering Library
> A simplistic rendering library using OpenGL and PyGame as the backend engine.


## Notes

A reimplementation of [08: rendergl](../08-rendergl/) that gets rid of the camera files, and instead adds some interactivity to be able to rotate and translate the teapot.

This version does not include the camera files (which I don't know how to operate), but supports certain interactivity from the users so that they can:

+ Press x, y, z to rotate the scene about the corresponding axis. They act like on/off switches.
+ press key up, key down to translate the scene in the y axis
+ press key up, key down to translate the scene in the y axis
