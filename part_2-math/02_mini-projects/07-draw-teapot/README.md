# Drawing the Utah Teapot
> Illustrates how to render the Utah teapot using OpenGL and PyGame as the backend technologies.


## Usage Notes

The example assumes that you have your system configured to run OpenGL demos as described in [prerequisites](../06-octahedron-opengl-pygame/README.md#prerequisites).

After that, you will need to `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then type:


```bash
(.venv) $ python draw_teapot.py
```

## Implementation Notes

The implementation relies on a few supporting libraries included in the directory that contains the minimum necessary code to render the teapot. You will find those libraries with more comprehensive implementation in other examples.
