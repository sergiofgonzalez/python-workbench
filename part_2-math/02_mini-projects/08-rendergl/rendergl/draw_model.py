        faces (list[list[tuple[IntOrFloat, IntOrFloat, IntOrFloat]]]): a list of
           lists of triangles designating the faces of a 3D shape. Note that the
           vertices of each corresponding face must be arranged in a way that

        colormap: a Matplotlib colormap that will be used for shading.

        light ([tuple[IntOrFloat, IntOrFloat, IntOrFloat]): a vector giving the
            light source orientation.

        glTranslatef_args (Seq[float, float, float]): a sequence of 3 floating
            points for x, y, z that will change the perspective from which we
            observe the scene. For example, using (0.0, 0.0, -5) will move the
            scene away from the viewer 5 units; (0.0, 0.0, -25) will move it
            further, thus causing the scene to look smaller.By default,
            (0.0, 0.0, -5) will be used.

        glRotatef_args (Seq[float, float, float, float]): a sequence of 4
            floating points that will change the angle at which we observe the
            scene. The expected values are for the angle, and then specification
            about an axis given for the second, third, and fourth value. That
            is, theta, x, y, z rotates the whole scene by the angle theta about
            an axis specified by the vector (x, y, z).
