# Managing algebraic symbolic expressions
> v2: expansion and other capabilities

## Description

This project illustrates how to handle symbolic expressions in Python by declaring a class hierarchy that models numbers and variables as elements and operations as combinators.

Apart from the class hierarchy defined in [`expressions.py`](symexpr/expressions.py), additional functions are defined in [`utils.py`](symexpr/utils.py).
