> a collection of Math mini-projects

## [01: Vector 2D library](./01_vector-2d-lib/README.md)

A library to draw simple figures such as points, segments, polygons, and  arrows in the 2D plane using Matplotlib as the backend.

## [02: Vector 2D library refactoring](./02_vector-2d-lib-refactoring/)

Refactoring the Vector 2D library to accommodate both graphing and Math functions.

## [03: Vector 3D library](./03_vector-3d-lib/README.md)

A helper library to draw simple figures in the 3D space using Matplotlib as the backend.

## [04: Vector 2D library for rendering](./04_vector-2d-lib-for-rendering/README.md)

A small update on the 2D library to support the rendering of 3D objects in 2D.

## [05: Rendering a 3D sphere](./05_rendering-3d-sphere/README.md)

Illustrates how to use the existing [`vec2d`](https://pypi.org/project/vec2d/) and [`vec3d`](https://pypi.org/project/vec3d/) to create a very simplistic rendering capability using Matplotlib as the backend.
The project also includes a simpler example in which a octahedron is rendered using the same technique.

## [06: Rendering a Octahedron](./06-octahedron-opengl-pygame/README.md)

Illustrates how to render the same octahedron from [05_rendering-3d-sphere](05_rendering-3d-sphere/render_octahedron.py) but using OpenGL as the graphics backend instead of Matplotlib and PyGame to handle interactivity and user related stuff.

## [07: Drawing the Utah Teapot](./07-draw-teapot/README.md)

Illustrates how to render the Utah teapot using OpenGL and PyGame as the backend technologies.

## [08: Render GL library](./08-rendergl/README.md)

A simplistic rendering library using OpenGL and PyGame as the backend engine.

## [09: Draw Teapot library (no cam + animation)](./09-rendergl-no-cam/README.md)

A reimplementation of [08: rendergl](../08-rendergl/) that gets rid of the camera files, and instead adds some interactivity to be able to rotate and translate the teapot.

## [10: Matrix library](10_mat-lib/README.md)

## [11: Render GL library (with matrix support)](11-rendergl-no-cam-matrix/README.md)
